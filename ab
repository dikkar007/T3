I’m excited for Tuesday meeting. (In the past, I have done demonstration for larger, smaller group & have tailored the message based on audience.)
Live demonstration micro services and micro front end – 10 minutes. 
Slide 1 – 9 – 20 minutes. (There is more contain on micro-service slide & we will spend more time on micro-fronted slide, as this is now really becoming micro-frontend discussion)
Now Summary slide. 
From here based on discussion questions may go back to the slides or to live demonstration 
I have updated Summary Slide with Node.js from google, typescript from microsoft, react from facebook, devops from docker. 
Few talking on summary screen.
All these projects node, react typescript, docker are open source. Difference with these open source projects and other, are these are well funded & managed by three large tech companies and input from community like any other open source. These 3 large tech companies have recommended each other on their website with recommended development 
Reactjs is best solution for micro front as angular is 5 times bigger in size than react. Angular may turn out good solution for pure Micro Service framework and once Micro frontend word is out, I don’t think new projects will start without Micro-Frontend  If someone has other better argument here or in near future, our framework “Micro Frontend with Micro Services” supports that.
Tech stack on summary screen is highly recommending. Almost every new project mobile or web starting with this tech stack. 
I will be working tonight for Legal Hold 1.2 implementation. I will be available, checking email over the weekend and will be working on Monday.
