Recommended approach from Chase Architect team is to query Eureka DB over using Export API. 
  1) Can you please send us Eureka Schema details and DB related documentation?
  2) Is Demo site provides access to DB? So, we can start development here.
  3) We will also need help from you to document pros/cons of using direct DB access vs Export API.    
  
Hopefully some of these things we resolved over email, if not we will need a meeting to discuss this. We will need to add this on agenda for weekly status meeting with Nuance / Call Miner.
