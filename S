History : After working for 1 decade and serving in various capacity Shirish moved from Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company to JPMorgan Chase & Co. He is on right very successful track / path with CCB. In Nationwide, unfortunately he was getting dragged into different path, not into his core strength. He probably could have over come this challenge, however new / current position came too fast.

Current :
He likes his current team and the current project. Most importantly he honestly, sincerely enjoys his work here and doesn't look at it as work. Currently he is reporting to excellent manager and structure and that makes him very productive and takes best out of him. That was missed for last several years.

Recently, he has put together excellent framework, based on his past experience and current need. Micro-Frontend with Micro-services. Currently there is very minimal technical and political support for this. He thinks, he alone can overcome both these challenges with the help from ledership to make this as reality. There are significant cost savings benefits short term and long term with this framework, such making our people naturally t-shaped, reduce development and regression testing on going cost, easier to maintain, scale and upgrade application. with his passion for this with Agile practices

Future:
His immediate goal is to deliver Praesto Analytics Project with highest quality, with "came here, introduced the right technologies and delivered the project right way".

His long term career goal is move into Architect role and then into CTO. Getting into door with 602 position, doesn't keep him aligned with that goal and this potentially may negatively impact on his productivity and commitment. He rather prefer to stay as consultant and continue freely pursue on his long term career path.

Looking for 603 position / title with $165k+benefits / annum.
