I’m excited for Tuesday's meeting. (In the past, I have done demonstrations for larger, smaller groups and have tailored the message based on the audience.)

Live demonstration micro services and micro- frontend – 10 minutes. 
Slide 1–9 – 20 minutes. (There is more content on micro-service slide & we will spend more time on micro-frontend slide, as this is now really more becoming a micro-frontend discussion).

Now Summary slide: 
From here, based on discussions / questions, may go back to previous slides or to live demonstration.
I have updated Summary Slide with Node.js from google, typescript from microsoft, react from facebook, devops from docker. 
Few talking points on summary screen.
All these projects node, react, typescript, docker are open source. Difference with these open source projects and other, are these are well funded & managed by three large tech companies and input from community like any other open source. These 3 large tech companies have recommended each other on their websites. I have included those links in notes section. 
React.js is the best solution for micro-front as Angular is 5 times bigger in size than React. Angular may turn out to be a good solution for pure Micro Service framework, and once Micro- frontend word is out, I don’t think new projects will start without Micro-Frontend. If someone has other thoughts here or in near future, our framework “Micro-Frontend with Micro Services” does support that.
Tech stack on summary screen is highly recommended. Almost every new project, mobile or web, is starting with this tech stack. 
I will be working tonight for Legal Hold 1.2 implementation. I will be available, checking email over the weekend and will be working on Monday.
