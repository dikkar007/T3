Thanks Victor for todayâ€™s meeting. 
Very minor correction, Nuance voice Bio development environment is setup. Call Miner Eureka development environment is not yet setup or installed. Potentially, API to listen to call will be developed by our Call Recording team and will provide that to you. Rest of the information that you looking for will be coming from our Analytics Call Miner Team. I will be confirming this and will get back to you in very near future.
