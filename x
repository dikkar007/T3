If Chandra is available he can help me on export / ingest api. Scott can help on UI related changes 

Now export. Below requirement is not yet confirm, however Webstats expecting below information on Day 1. This can be provided from eco system; that means we will have export data from Call Miner for Day 1. This is not UI requirement; potentially we can use Call Miner UI for Day 1 with modification such as logo and the enhance UI from there. 

Forgot to Cc you. Though there is no API to ingest data in Call Miner, current business requirement day 1 need ingestion capability. Potential solution, export data from Call Miner into our eco-system and ingest below data in ecosystem and provide search capability etc.

Praesto Analytics project there is a requirement to ingest data in Call Miner such as social media data, complain to executive office, email data, text data, post call survey results and other digital data. Before ingesting the data, need to pull the data from various sources.  If you can share the information on how to pull this data, that will be helpful.  I will be also scheduling meeting to discuss these requirement.
