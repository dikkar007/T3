============

I had 1:1 discussion with Fred today. Couple of things we discussed, we need to get to backlog ready for development. By 06/19 environment will be setup, then install vendor software, support for that. 
As we get to backlog ready for development we will get the idea of how large this effort in terms of points/hours. Fred indicated that there was discussion from program on adding more people to meet certain date.
