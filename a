Team,
DEI setup is now finally complete.  It took little time to configure it for Type Script. It’s now complete. DEI is used for static code analysis.  This is our first code analysis and results are Great with technical debt ratio 0.1% and something can be resolved in 15 minutes, we will have story card to resolve this gap for next sprint. This static code analysis is for one of critical component – Export Utility Micro Service for Unified UI.  This is initial foundational code for Export Utility Micro Service.

Thank You for help to getting this escalated and resolved for me. Finally, I was able to submit the request this morning for Cassandra DB for Praesto Analytics Project.
