We will have the audio files here before we receive SFTP credentials from Call Miner. We can communicated our ETA is this Friday 05/04. I donâ€™t have access to send email to vendor. 

One more question for Call Miner: When / ETA will we receive proposal / option regarding Unified UI? 

This is good now we have access to Call Miner instance and soon we will have access to API. Now, we can establish authentication mechanism / story for Export Micro-Service and other story cards.
