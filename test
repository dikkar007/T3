I think we need to wait on hearing the proposal / options from Call Miner on unified API / UI etc. Then we need to make a collective decision on move forward plan on this. We don’t want to give something to PO now and after 2 months other product – Unified UI. Also, I don’t think our business is keen on getting this access at this minute. I think, we will give them Unified UI as soon as Call Miner installed in our UAT environment.
