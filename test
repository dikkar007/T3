Analytics UI Hierarchy need based on Meta Data
1) Need logged user role. Input SID, return role.
2) Direct report list. Input SID, return direct report list. This service exists  today- Team management service.
3) Service to send hierarchy information (or, segment, site and team name) to Call Miner â€“ Eureka. 
4) Search filter criteria 
	a.UI pull hierarchy information from webstats and compare with call results.
	b.Or user search and then we enable filter criteria related to hierarchy based on result
	c.Or UI maintain hierarchy based on exported data  
All the above need of 4 services goes away, if we go with decision that webstats share flat file of hierarchy information every 24 hours and Analytics team take care providing hierarchy information to Eureka and UI needs.
