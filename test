Based on a discussion earlier this week and the below email on dashboard, I do think we should start with new Jira board and team, instead of adding Prestro Analytics cards on existing board / team. Today, we cannot involve PO in sprint meetings (planning, refinement, retro, demo, daily scrum) as on one team we have MC, L3, LH, infrastructure.. A smaller team focused on their project will make sprint meetings more productive and that will also improve overall team's velocity.

This is aligned with recommended approach from organization and we should start with that.
