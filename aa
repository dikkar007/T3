I think question we had for Call Miner was, what are the steps to install product in our environment. Detail project / plan steps to install product.
If time permit two more questions. 
When ingest API will be available? 
We have already requested for Live access to Eureka API, Call Miner Eureka and My Call Miner Eureka from vendor environment. Where are we on this? This will also help to get a deeper understanding of each of the API and overall product. Not to wait till product get installed in our environment. 
Not sure if Bryant has any other questions for vendor.
