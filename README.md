HiThis is helpful. I was able to get these api working for extract transcript and audio download. I will review this with Bryant and incorporate his feedback, as needed. 

I'm going to reply to below email and request for additional api's data. And, If possible access to live access to Eureka API, Call Miner Eureka and My Call Miner Eureka.

Can you please send data for other export API? 
Also, is it possible to get live access to Eureka API, Call Miner Eureka and My Call Miner Eureka from your environment?
