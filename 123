I’m interested in Knock homes 1) tech stack, 2) true remote opportunity & 3) personally buying two homes experience felt like rip-off. However, I don’t have this experience at CarMax. Also company started by Trulia / Zillow founders. I believe in Knock Home, there is need here. 
Excellent knowledge in API design with Node.js. Very motivated and committed to project / software development. Not direct experience with AWS ecosystem and have work on Google Cloud storage. Experience with Docker, dev-ops.  I have also applied for Frontend Engineer Job as well.
