I haven’t seen much engagement from him in daily standup meeting, neither I have seen he is taking ownership. For me it doesn’t feel like he is working with team. However, I haven’t seen his technical expertise and haven’t worked with him directly so far. Also, I don’t know about his allocation and priorities.  So, it’s premature for me to make final call.
